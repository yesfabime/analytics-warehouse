# analytics-warehouse
Some Engineers, Tec-PMs and Chapter Leads of MediaMarktSaturn Technology are currently building within this company the next generation of a Datawarehouse - a so called Analytics Warehouse. We are trying to give you insights of challenges and important facts to consider building something similar within your organisation. 
We try to formulate our insights very clearly - sometimes this may feel that we are overstating things. This is intentionally as we want to emphasize the core message of what we've encountered within the last years while building this.

### Note
We are currently building up this portal - if you have specific questions, feel free to ping 192256054fs@googlemail.com
