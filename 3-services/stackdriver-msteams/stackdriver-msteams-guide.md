# Guide to Stackdriver - MS Teams Connector
Typically Stackdriver provides a lot of native notification channels to various tools. Unfortunately there is no native MS Teams connector available. This was the reason why we've created a serverless connector that forwards messages from Stackdriver directly to a respective MS Teams Channel. If you want to get more in touch with the implementation details, feel free to [read here more about it]({{site.baseurl}}/arch-principles-tenet/stackdriver-msteams/).<br/>
To get an overview, you can have a look at our architectural diagram:
