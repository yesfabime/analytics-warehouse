# Data Catalog

Imagine the following situation: You want to start 
a new data-driven project. For this project you need different kinds of data. In a modern distributed multiproject GCP 
landscape you quickly lose the overview in which table in which project the desired data can be found. Wouldn't it 
be very helpful if there was a kind of *catalog* where all the data and their connection to other data are bundled?

Therefore we created our own **Data Catalog**. [Click here for further information]({{site.baseurl}}/services/data-catalog/).

# Pipe as a Service
Our overarching goal is to build a [distributed data mesh](https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-monolith-to-mesh.html){:target="_blank"} for every datasource that lives within MediaMarktSaturn. This implies that we move from a legacy batch processing mode to a full streaming approach. A big enabler for this is a toolset that enables you to make use of streaming pipelines without getting in touch with too much details. This is the reason why we introduce Pipe as a Service.
