# Data Catalog


# Pipe as a Service
Our overarching goal is to build a [distributed data mesh](https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-monolith-to-mesh.html){:target="_blank"} for every datasource that lives within MediaMarktSaturn. This implies that we move from a legacy batch processing mode to a full streaming approach. A big enabler for this is a toolset that enables you to make use of streaming pipelines without getting in touch with too much details. This is the reason why we introduce Pipe as a Service.
